# SudokuSolver
Solve any Suduko puzzle using this solver GUI built using Python and Tkinter.
The code uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
There are two ways to run the program. The first of which involves using the GUI. Begin by importing gui.py into your IDE of choice. Then run the program and a window will appear.
Input your chosen Sudoku puzzle into the cells of the window. Leave any empty cells blank. Then simply click "solve" to complete the puzzle or "clear" to clear the puzzle.<br>
<br>

Alternatively, you can run the program without a GUI using the solver.py script. Simply import the script into your IDE of choice. Then fill out the 2D board vector at the top of the file.
Fill in empty cells with a zero. After filling in the board vector, you can run the program. The output will be printed to the console.
